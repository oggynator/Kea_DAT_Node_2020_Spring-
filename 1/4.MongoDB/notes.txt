Relational Database vs. NoSQL 

MySQL                   MongoDB
MariaDB                 DynamoDB
OracleDB                Firebase
PostgreSQL              Neo4J
MsSQL                   Realm
CouchDB

// MongoDB

collections: furniture
[
    {
        "key": "value"
    },
    {
        "price": 20.00
    },
    {

    }
]

// MongoDB usecases

Do use: 

- Not sure about the schema yet
    - Leads to rapid prototyping
        - Type of companies: start-ups

Don't use:

- Data that is consistent or relational

- Data that is crucial, you have to be careful

- If you have a set schema


More info:
    MongoDB you handle relations, data validation etc. in the application layer
    For relational database you can also do it in the application layer 
                    but the database is another safety net
